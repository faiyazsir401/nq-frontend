  {
    question:
      "Will I get a refund if there was bad Internet connection and I was unable to have a successful session?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Yes. If you have a bad experience for any reason, we will refund your
        money. Let us know within two business days of attending the session
        unsuccessfully. We do encourage you to test your set-up before your
        first session, so that you won’t use session time addressing
        connectivity problems. When technical problems arise during a session,
        experts are typically very willing to reschedule and try again. The goal
        is to get you connected and learning, but if it's not possible, you will
        get your money back.
